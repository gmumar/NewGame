2016-08-03 04:15:56,880 [INFO] JRE from "JRE_HOME"  - not set.
2016-08-03 04:15:56,880 [WARN] WARNING! It appears you do not have JAVA_HOME and JRE_HOME environment variables set.
This is not necessarily a problem, but it may lead to errors during CodeRunner execution.
If you experience problems related to security policy permissions, the JAR utility or others,
please try setting up the JAVA_HOME environment variable by pointing it to the root directory
of your JDK location (must be version 1.8 or higher).
